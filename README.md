# Lattice: The Swarm Intelligence Engine for Mesh AI

> **TL;DR:** Lattice is an open protocol and runtime for mesh, agentic AI, enabling anyone, anywhere, to contribute compute and co-create resilient, intelligent systems beyond the limits of the cloud.

Lattice is where anyone can help build, run, and own the next generation of AI infrastructure, powered by swarm intelligence, not centralized servers.

At its core, Lattice is a self-organizing, peer-to-peer protocol and runtime for agentic AI workloads. It turns idle GPUs, edge devices, and home labs into a global mesh, where intelligence emerges from the collaboration of thousands of autonomous nodes. Imagine running a large language model across idle GPUs in your city, or training models on data that never leaves your device, all without relying on a single cloud provider.

## Why Now? The Cloud Bottleneck & the Rise of Swarm AI

- **Centralized AI clouds** are expensive, fragile, and closed, locking innovators into proprietary silos and creating single points of failure.
- **Edge devices, home labs, and idle GPUs** are everywhere, but lack a unifying protocol for secure, dynamic collaboration.
- **AI is becoming agentic:** The next wave of applications will require real-time, distributed, and resilient intelligence that no single server can provide.

> Lattice is the answer: a protocol and platform for self-organizing, agentic AI networks, where compute, data, and intelligence flow freely, securely, and efficiently.

## Mission & Vision
Lattice is building the **“Internet of AI Agents”**, a resilient, open, and adaptive mesh for distributed inference, collaborative learning, and real-time AI at scale.

- **Empower anyone:** Run, contribute, and monetize AI workloads
- **Unleash emergent intelligence:** Swarm dynamics and agentic negotiation
- **Make AI infrastructure unstoppable:** As open, adaptive, and resilient as the internet itself

## What Makes Lattice Different?

- **Agentic Nodes:** Every node in Lattice is an autonomous agent, self-aware, self-optimizing, and capable of negotiating, executing, and verifying complex AI tasks. This agentic design means the network is truly self-organizing and peer-to-peer, with no single point of failure or control.
- **Swarm Intelligence:** Lattice’s intelligence emerges from real-time, peer-to-peer negotiation between nodes. There’s no central scheduler; instead, nodes dynamically match requirements to resources, optimizing for proximity, latency, and availability across the mesh.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** The secure, context-rich backbone for communication. Nodes advertise capabilities, discover peers, negotiate tasks, and share results, all peer-to-peer.
- **Heterogeneous by Design:** Lattice unifies everything from datacenter GPUs to edge devices and home computers, leveraging all available compute, everywhere.
- **Resilience & Adaptivity:** Nodes can join, leave, or fail at any time, Lattice adapts instantly, reallocating tasks and healing itself for unstoppable execution.
- **Task Compatibility Matching:** Only nodes with the right hardware/software get the right jobs: GPU tasks go to GPU nodes, streaming jobs to low-latency peers, and so on.
- **Built for Heavy Loads:** From distributed LLM inference to federated learning and real-time streaming, Lattice is architected for demanding, distributed AI workloads.

## How Lattice Works: Architecture in Action

1. **Node Joins:** Runs a system profiler, advertises resources (CPU, GPU, RAM, bandwidth, etc.)
2. **Discovery:** Finds peers via DHT/bootstrap nodes, no central registry.
3. **Capability Broadcast:** Shares live profile and availability with the network via MCP.
4. **Task Submission:** Users or nodes submit tasks with requirements (e.g., model, hardware, latency).
5. **Swarm Allocation:** Nodes self-organize, negotiate, and claim tasks best suited to their profile.
6. **Execution & Return:** Task runs, results are returned directly via MCP.
7. **Continuous Update:** Nodes update status, enabling real-time adaptation and resilience.
